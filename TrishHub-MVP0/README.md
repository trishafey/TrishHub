# TrishHub (MVP0 Skeleton)

This is the MVP0 project skeleton for TrishHub.

## What’s included

- Basic PHP project structure
- Simple front controller and router
- Empty controllers, services, and models
- Example config and environment file
- Database migration SQL files

## Getting started (very rough)

1. Copy `config/env.local.php.example` to `config/env.local.php` and update values.
2. Create a MySQL database and run the SQL files in `database/migrations` (optional for MVP0).
3. Point your web server’s document root to the `public/` directory.
4. Open `/login` or `/repos` in your browser to start wiring up logic.

This skeleton is intentionally minimal — it’s a starting point for MVP1.
